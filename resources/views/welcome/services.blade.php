                    <p>Bitcoin is not backed or its value guaranteed by any financial institution, thus when a
                        client buys bitcoins, they do so
                        at their own risk. Before buying any bitcoins, customers should do some research and
                        weigh their options. The firm gives
                        no assurances whatsoever on the worth of the bought bitcoins in the future.</p>

                    <p>All other paragraphs of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in the event
                        that any court should rule one
                        or more sections of this Agreement to be invalid or void. This would not render the
                        entire Agreement invalid.</p>
